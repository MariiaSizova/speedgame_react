## How to play?

1. The game starts with all the lights off.
2. The lights turn on one at a time in random order, accelerating all the time.
3. Each light illumination is acknowledged by pressing the light button that comes on.
4. If you press the correct button, the game continues with the next light button. Your score will increase.
5. If you press the wrong button, the game ends.
6. You have an opportunity to skip up to 3 light buttons by not pressing anything. Skipping a button will not affect the game outcome.
7. The game continues until you make three mistakes or skip three lights.
8. Your score is based on how many buttons you correctly press before the game ends. The higher your score, the better you did.
9. The game can be restarted at any time by pressing a reset button.
